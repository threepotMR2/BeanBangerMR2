BeanBangerMR2
=============

This is an adaption/fork for the BeanMPX project by fiztech-code - thank you for amazing work, this would not exist without you.

I have no idea what I'm doing but have butched the BeanMPX project to make this do what it should. It is probably the worst code man has seen, and I am probably using Github in totally the wrong way. Please forgive my stupidity and ignorance!

All you need is in the BeanBangerMR2 folders, one is the arduino project, the other is the gerber/bom for the PCB.

Here is some testing video footage and description of usage:-

You will see it completed here:-

There is a very messy spreadsheet that "helps" to make the formula for to convert the analogue input voltage to the BEAN temp hex value.

Enjoy!
